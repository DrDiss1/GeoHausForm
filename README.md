# Geohaus Form
The form system for the Geohaus Website. Injected into Woocommerce, it queries Google Maps with the coordinates of the chosen suburb, then calculates how far away that suburb is to a fixed location.
Then it'll assign a number to the Woocommerce product, so that can calculate the cost of the job.
